A simple OCaml program building a gtk window and displaying a MathML formula.

Building this program via "make" requires the following:
 - ocamlbuild
 - ocamlfind
 - lablgtk2
 - lablgtkmathview

On an debian/ubuntu machine, you can for instance run as root:
apt-get install ocamlbuild ocaml-findlib liblablgtk2-ocaml-dev liblablgtkmathview-ocaml-dev

On other platform, it is recommended to use the Opam package manager
for OCaml for installing these dependencies.
